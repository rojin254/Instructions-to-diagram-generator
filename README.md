# Instruction to Flowchart Generator

This application converts instructional text extracted from images into flowcharts using two methods: POS tagging and LLM-based generation. It leverages libraries like Tesseract OCR, spaCy, and Ollama's LLMs.

## Prerequisites

### Install Python
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Install Tesseract OCR
Tesseract OCR must be installed separately. Follow the instructions for your operating system:
- **Windows**: Download and install Tesseract from [UB Mannheim](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).
- **Mac/Linux**: Install via Homebrew or your package manager.

### Install Ollama
Ollama CLI must be installed, and the Llama 3.1 model should be available.
1. Download and install Ollama from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai/).
2. Add the Llama 3.1 model to Ollama using the following command:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.1
   ```

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
Create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries using `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the Streamlit App
Start the Streamlit application with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Step 4: Upload Image and Generate Flowchart
1. Upload an image containing instructions.
2. View flowcharts generated by two methods.
3. Select your preferred method and save the evaluation.

## TODO

[ ] Caching for LLM-generated Diagrams
[ ] User Input for LLM Model Selection
[ ] Error Handling

## Troubleshooting
- **Tesseract not found**: Ensure the `tesseract_cmd` path in the script is correctly configured.
- **Ollama not installed**: Verify Ollama CLI installation and model availability.
- **Dependency issues**: Ensure all libraries in `requirements.txt` are installed.
